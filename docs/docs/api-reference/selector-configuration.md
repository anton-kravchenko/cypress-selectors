# Selector Configuration

Every selector accepts `configuration` as a second argument:

```typescript
type ExternalSelectorConfig = {
  alias?: string;
  parentAlias?: string;
  attribute?: string;
  eq?: number;
  timeout?: number;
  parent?: Selector;
  ignoreCase?: boolean;
};
```

### `alias`

Assigns an `alias` to a selector. This `alias` can be used to reference that element as a parent of another selector.

### `parentAlias`

Allows referencing parent of a selector via its `alias`.

:::note
Please note, that _child-parent_ relationship _via alias_ works only within one class.
:::

### `attribute`

Custom attribute to be used by `@ByAttribute` selector. Being ignored by all other selectors.

### `eq`

Index of a DOM element in an array of elements.

:::note
Works with both `XPath` and `CSS` selectors. However, please note that it is not going to work if your `XPath` selector returns `string`, `number` of `boolean`.
:::

### `timeout`

Selector timeout. By default, the library inherits `timeout` configuration from Cypress.

### `parent`

Allows referencing parent of a selector via reference to another selector.
:::note

1. This kind of _child-parent_ relationship doesn't have 'one-class' limitation and works across all classes with selectors.
2. It is possible use the `XPath` selector as a parent for the `CSS` selector and vise versa.
3. `XPath` selectors that specify parents, should use relative location path (e.g. `./div` instead of `//div`). Otherwise, `parent` attribute for `XPath` selector that uses absolute location path is going to be ignored.

:::

### `ignoreCase`

Makes text selector case insensitive.
:::note
Works only with `@ByExactText`, `@ByPartialText`, `@ByPartialLinkText` and `@ByExactLinkText` selectors.
